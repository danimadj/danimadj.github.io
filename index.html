  <p>on rare occasions, where i wake up really early and have the time to make breakfast, my go-to meal is a grilled cheese sandwich. it's an appetizing meal that surely satisfies my stomach in the morning. here's how i make my own grilled cheese sandwich in under about 12 minutes.</p>
  <h2>˗ˏˋ<i>ingredients</i>´ˎ˗</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>mozerella</li>
      <li>2 slices of white bread</li>
      <li>butter</li>
      <li>2 strips of bacon</li>
      <li>1 egg<div></div></li>
    </ol>
  <h2>˗ˏˋ<i>steps</i>´ˎ˗</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>turn up some music!</strong> i like to play my favorite <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2W6Hvrtg2Zpc9dW4aBDbdP?si=5_pqB4G2TfmVutBa-EuImQ">album</a> at the moment.</a></li>
      <li><strong>prep the bacon and egg!</strong> oil and heat up your pan on medium-heat. once the pan is ready, crack an egg and cook until the whites are white. bring the egg onto a separate plate. then, cook the bacon for 2-4 minutes on each side. now, bring the bacon to the plate.</li>
      <li><strong>toast your bread!</strong> melt the butter, covering the surface of the pan and add in both slices of bread. make sure the bread soaks up all of the butter from the pan. leave for 2 minutes until golden and crispy. to butter the side that's facing up, lift up one of the slices, melt butter onto the pan, then flip the bread onto the butter. repeat for the other slice of bread. for this part, you don't need to wait for the bread to be toasted.</li>
      <li><strong>add the cheese!</strong> on a low-medium heat, stack everything, starting with the mozerella cheese, onto one of the slices of bread. take the other slice of bread and flip it with the newly-buttered side facing up. leave for 2 minutes and flip. wait another 2 minutes, and voilà! it is now ready to eat! </li>
      </ol>
